# Results

## Systematic Scoping Review

Initial search yielded 7529 results of which 4364 remained after automated filtering and removal of duplicates (see flow diagram in @fig-flow). Out of the random sample (n = 500), 242 articles were included in the final analysis.

Reporting practices of the methodology of gas exchange measures differed widely across the literature (see @tbl-reporting). More than half (51.8%) of the articles did not report any information regarding their data processing strategy. One in twenty articles (5.4%) provided a rationale for their used strategy. Only a single article [@maturana2021] reported information regarding all the investigated criteria.

Out of the authors that provided information and collected breath-by-breath measurements, most (79.5%) utilized binned averages to determine V̇O~2max~. Moving time averages, or breath-based averages were uncommon (see @fig-strategies). No study used methods of digital filtering to determine V̇O~2max~.

For preprocessing, some authors reported the use of a (linear) interpolation for the breath-by-breath data to seconds (n = 7; 4.3%). A minority of researchers reported the use of data filtering strategies to remove outliers. This included the use of initial data smoothing by a short moving average (3 seconds, n = 1; 5 breaths, n = 3), the manual detection and removal of outliers (n = 2) or an automated removal of outliers (n = 5). For the automated outlier detection authors removed single data points differing from a local mean by a varying number of standard deviations (2, 3 or 4) or being outside of a 95% confidence interval. When reported, the software used for data processing varied among studies showing a total of more than 15 reported programs (for 30 studies that reported this parameter).

The calculation interval for time-based averages of mixing chamber and breath-by-breath devices ranged from 5 to 60 seconds (see @fig-duration). 30 second length intervals were most common to define V̇O~2max~, while authors also often employed shorter (10-20 s) and longer (60 s) periods.
