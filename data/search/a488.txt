Using a verification phase test (VP) following a graded exercise test has
been shown to be superior to secondary criteria to determine a “true”
VO2max. It has not been determined if a sex difference in the optimal
intensity for cycle ergometry VP testing exists. 31 participants (16
females, age: 21±1.5 yrs, BMI: 23.2±3.3 kg/m2; 15 males, age: 22±1.5
yrs, BMI: 24.5± 2.2 kg/m2) completed a ramp VO2max test, then on 4
subsequent days, in random order, completed VP tests at 80, 90, 100,
and 105% of the peak wattage achieved during the initial ramp test. The
VO2max values for each test (Ramp, 80, 90, 100, and 105%) for women
were 2.36±0.35, 2.29±0.03, 2.34±0.33, 2.35±0.32, 2.32±0.32 L/min and
for men were 3.65±0.66, 3.67±0.71, 3.67±0.67, 3.55±0.51, 3.49±0.48
L/min. For males VO2max at 105% was significantly lower than Ramp
(P=0.02), 80% (P <0.01), 90% (P=0.02). There was also a trend for
VO2max at 80% to be higher than 100% (P=0.08). Females showed no
significant differences between VO2max values for any VP or Ramp test. 10
of the 16 female subjects had their highest VO2max during the 100 or
105% VP, while 12 of 15 male subjects had their highest from a
submaximal VP. When comparing all VPs a trend for sex x test interaction
(P =0.08) was observed. Submaximal VP intensities of 80% and 90% of
max wattage achieved on the ramp test produce the highest VO2max
values in males. In females the maximal and supramaximal intensities
most frequently produced the highest VO2max values whereas the 80% led
to excessive time to exhaustion (9.23±4.99 min). In order to obtain the
highest VO2max values in the most optimal test time we recommend using
90% of max wattage in males and 100 or 105% of max wattage in
females
