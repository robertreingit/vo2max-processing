PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), 1,500 meter run (1500-R), and the 20-m multistage shuttle run (MS-R) according to aerobic fitness level in Korean young men.

METHODS: Ninety nine young men (19.5±0.9 yrs; 175.6±5.6 cm; 67.8±8.8 kg; 22.0±2.4 kg/m2; 16±4.9 %fat) participated in three randomly ordered testings. In one occasion, they ran on a treadmill with an incremental work load to determine their VO2max. In other occasions, they ran on a track for 1500-R time trial and performed MS-R, twice for each test. They were categorized according to ACSM guidelines based on the VO2max (in ml·kg-1·min-1), into four fitness groups; average (A; 41.5-44.9, n=18), good (G; 45.0-49.9, n=21), very good (VG; 50.0-54.9, n=30), and excellent (E; 54.9<, n=30). The better score of two trials of 1500-R and MS-R was taken for the analyses.

RESULTS: The average VO2max was 42.8±1.6, 47.2±1.5, 51.9±1.3, and 59.4±3.1 ml·kg-1·min-1 in A, G, VG, and E, respectively. The best record of 1500-R was 429±44, 416±66, 387±45, and 380±31 sec and that of MS-R was 65±16, 71±18, 76±21, and 82±19 repetitions in A, G, AG, and E, respectively. When the record were compared by groups, it was only different between A and E in both 1500-R (ANOVA, p<0.005) and MS-R (ANOVA, p<0.05). The Pearson Correlation Coefficients were only significant between 1500-R and MS-R in all groups (-0.676 in A, -0.779 in G, -0.671 in VG, and -0.461 in E; p<0.01) while no significance was noticed between VO2max and two field tests.

CONCLUSION: Records of both 1500-R and MS-R appear to increase progressively by fitness level, but the outcome of field endurance tests only differentiate the maximal aerobic capacity between the average and the excellent aerobic capacity groups. Two field tests were highly correlated with each other, but not with VO2max in all fitness levels.
