First sentences:
We wish to applaud Jenkins, Mauger, and Hopker (2016)
for following previous encouragement to address the mech-
anistic bases by which the self-paced ̇ VO 2 max protocol
(SPV) test may increase ̇ VO 2 max (Poole et al. 2014). Pre-
viously, Mauger et al. (2013) reported that the SPV (per -
formed on a non-motorized treadmill) increased ̇ VO 2 max to
~119% of that achievable on a graded motorized treadmill
test.
